# Agentic EO hackathon

## Organizers

This event is organized by [Pi School](https://picampus-school.com/) and [BIFOLD](https://www.bifold.berlin/), in collaboration with [ESA Φ-lab](https://philab.esa.int/), as part of the [EVE project](https://eve.philab.esa.int/about).

The awards are sponsored and distributed by the [ESA Φ-lab Challenges Programme](https://challenges.philab.esa.int/).

The day is one Earth Observation question the agent cannot answer yet. You build the missing [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, test it against the live agent, and open a pull request to the [EVE MCP tool registry](https://github.com/eve-esa/mcp-tool-registry) so the same tool can be called from more than one client.

The programme, the worked example, delivery, and how to open that pull request are in [`START_HERE.ipynb`](START_HERE.ipynb). This page is the map of the repository.

```



## Where you work

You can do the whole day in the lab. Scan the QR code on the screen or on your table, enter the email you registered with, then the one-time code from that inbox. You land in a SageMaker JupyterLab space with this kit open, the **Agentic EO** kernel (Python 3.12), and GPUs on the instance. Open [`START_HERE.ipynb`](START_HERE.ipynb) and run it there. Your EVE API key is already in `.env` as `EVE_API_KEY`.

No code? Ask the help desk for a spare account.

You can also download this folder and work on your laptop, so you can use a coding assistant (Cursor, or another). The EVE API key still comes from the lab: copy `EVE_API_KEY` out of the lab `.env` into the `.env` on your machine. From this folder:

```bash
uv venv -p 3.12 && uv pip install -r requirements.txt jupyterlab
cp .env.example .env   # paste EVE_API_KEY from the lab
uv run jupyter lab
```

What we review is the notebook on your SageMaker instance. If you change the notebook or the server code on your laptop, upload those files back into the lab before the end of the day.

## Funding

This project is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) Φ-lab through the Large Language Model for Earth Observation and Earth Science project, as part of the Foresight Element within FutureEO Block 4 programme.
